# STracker

This is a University Project that I improved after a Udemy Swift Course I enrolled in 2020. This app allows to save multiple type of workout sessions, such as running, swimming, cycling, etc.

By use of third-party library **Chamaleon**, this app offers a nice design that can be customized changing the color theme whenever the user wants to. 

Currently the data of the application is being saved locally in the device using **Realm** third-party library.

# App screenshots
In this section I show all the activities of the application. First I show an example of the theme customization and then the general overview of the app.
